  <h1>Partner Colleges in Kenya</h1>

  <p>
    Murende Village offers a unique international learning pathway that prepares Kenyan students for a one-year
    practical training program in the Netherlands. This opportunity is open to colleges across Kenya that wish to
    strengthen their curriculum and invest in the long-term development of their students.
  </p>

  <h2>How Kenyan Colleges Can Join</h2>

  <p>
    Colleges that want to participate in this program must integrate the full learning pathway into their curriculum
    from the very beginning of a student's educational journey. This ensures that students build a strong foundation
    before travelling abroad, and that they are fully prepared for the expectations of practical training in the
    Netherlands.
  </p>

  <p>
    The international learning pathway includes:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Foundational training in healthcare support, plumbing, or basic electrical engineering</li>
    <li>Preparation for work culture, discipline, and professional behaviour</li>
    <li>Technical readiness for hands-on learning in the Netherlands</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Support After Returning to Kenya</h2>

  <p>
    A key requirement for partner colleges is to provide structured guidance when students return from their
    year abroad. This reintegration phase is essential for transforming international experience into meaningful,
    lasting development within Kenya.
  </p>

  <p>Reintegration support includes:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Professional mentorship after returning home</li>
    <li>Social and cultural reintegration guidance</li>
    <li><strong>A guaranteed work placement</strong> to ensure that skills learned abroad are applied directly
        within the Kenyan economy</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    By partnering with Murende Village, colleges help create a generation of highly skilled young professionals
    who return with practical experience, international exposure, and a commitment to building the future of their
    communities.
