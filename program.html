    <h2>1. Why This Program Exists</h2>
    <p>
        Young people in Murende and Western Kenya grow up with talent, energy, and a strong desire to build a better life. 
        But without practical skills and real work experience, it is difficult for them to find dignified jobs or start their own business.
        This program creates a concrete pathway: <strong>training in Murende, deep practical experience in the Netherlands, and then a committed return to Kenya.</strong>
    </p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Goal:</strong> Train young people from Murende College to become skilled professionals who return to Western Kenya and help develop their own communities.
    </div>
