    <h1>Murende Village</h1>
    <p>A Vision for Real Development in Western Kenya</p>
</header>

<main>
    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>
        Murende is a small, remote village in Western Kenya — a place where people are pure, open-hearted, 
        and full of potential. Yet despite this strength, the region has long lacked structured guidance, 
        meaningful work, and a clear vision for development.
    </p>

    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>
        Across Western Kenya, thousands of young people grow up with hope, talent, and energy — but without 
        the professional training needed to shape their future. Outside of Murende, where Murende College 
        offers several programs for young learners, there are almost no practical courses that truly equip 
        students with market-ready skills. And even for those who complete basic education, continued guidance 
        and mentorship are often missing.
    </p>

  Today, thousands of young people in West Kenya grow up with hope, talent, and energy — but without the professional
  training needed to shape their future. Outside of Murende Village, there are almost no practical programs that truly
  equip students with useful skills. Even those who complete school often need continued support and direction.

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
        Murende Village was created to change this reality. We believe that real development requires a 
        rigorous, honest approach: preparing young people with practical skills that directly match the needs 
        of their own communities.
    </p>

    <h2>Training in Kenya and the Netherlands</h2>
    <p>
        To achieve this, we collaborate with the Netherlands, offering selected students a one-year practical 
        learning program in fields such as healthcare support, plumbing, and basic electrical engineering.
    </p>

    <p>
        Students first receive foundational training here in Murende. They then continue their hands-on 
        education in the Netherlands, where they learn discipline, work ethics, craftsmanship, and modern 
        techniques. After this intensive year of training abroad, they return home — stronger, skilled, and ready 
        to contribute directly to the development of West Kenya.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
    <p>
        Murende Village invests in young people who want to learn, grow, and build a better future for their 
        communities. We believe that sustainable development begins with people — and in Murende, it begins 
        with you.
