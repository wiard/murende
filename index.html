  <h1>Murende College</h1>

  <p>
    <strong>Murende College prepares young students in Kenya for a one-year practical learning program in the Netherlands.</strong>
    Our curriculum focuses on essential skills in healthcare support, plumbing, and basic electrical engineering.
  </p>

  <p>
    Students follow a structured training pathway that builds the knowledge, discipline, and confidence they need to succeed abroad.
    They learn both technical foundations and social-cultural readiness, ensuring a smooth transition into Dutch vocational programs.
  </p>

  <p>
    After completing their year of hands-on learning in the Netherlands, students return to Kenya with internationally tested skills,
    ready to strengthen their communities and contribute directly to local development.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Murende College invests in young people who want to learn, grow, and bring sustainable progress back home.</strong>
